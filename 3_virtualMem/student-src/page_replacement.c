    is in use by another page mapping. In these cases, you must "evict"
    the frame by using the frame table to find the original mapping and

    Finds a free physical frame. If none are available, uses either a
    randomized or clock sweep algorithm to find a used frame for
    eviction.

    When implementing clock sweep, make sure you set the reference
    bits to 0 for each frame that had its referenced bit set. Your
    clock sweep should remember the index at which it leaves off and
    resume at the same place for each run (you may need to add a
    global or static variable for this).

    Return:
        The physical frame number of a free (or evictable) frame.

    HINTS: Use the global variables MEM_SIZE and PAGE_SIZE to calculate
    the number of entries in the frame table.
